        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Alejandra Hernandez and I am a freshman at University of California Riverside where I am majoring in Pre-Business. The concentration that I am focusing as of right now is accounting. I have always been interested in doing math ever since I was in elementary because I grasped on to it really quickly compared to my other classmates and even my twin sister. Since I love solving problems or even just finding what x equals, I decided to find a major where I could do math and be involved in the business industry. I also wondered what it was like to be in the business industry because business is literally everywhere we go. From shopping clothes, makeup, food, or anything in general to working for a company owned by someone else, there will always be business. I believe that studying business is important because we need to have a better understanding of what we are purchasing so that we do not get scammed by others. Adding on, I believe that business is also important because everyone wants to be their own boss so that they could earn their own money rather than working for someone else so that they receive the money. As time goes on, there are more people who are establishing their own small business so that they could support their family. This is also another reason why I decided to major in business, so that I could help my family financially. Providing for my family, especially my parents, is important to me because they have provided me with food and shelter for eighteen years and now it is my turn to give back to help.<br><br>

        Going to school has taught me to realize what my strengths and weaknesses are. With my strengths and weaknesses, I now know what my goal in school is and in life. For instance, my goal in life is that I want to help my parents once I have graduated college because I would have a job in the business industry. Some of my strengths are solving math equations quickly, being responsible by not getting behind on my schoolwork, being respectful by listening to what others have to say, and having patience. All these key strengths have really taught me more about myself and what I could overcome. However, with my strengths there are also weaknesses that affect me. For example, a weakness of mine is being too harsh on myself with every task that I complete or need to complete and also the ability to say the word no. These two weaknesses really impact me because I could be doing someone elseâ€™s work rather than doing mine so that it could be easier on them, even though I do not mind doing it. By the end of the day, strengths and weaknesses are both positive and negative at the same time.
